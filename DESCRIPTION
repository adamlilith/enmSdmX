Description: Tools for implementing species distribution models (SDMs) and
	ecological niche models (ENMs). The heart of the package is a set of
	"training" functions which automatically tune and parameterize
	a models based on several popular algorithms (e.g., MaxEnt, GLMs, BRTs,
	GAMs, etc.). Ancillary tools include functions for model evaluation,
	and calculation of biotic velocity (speed and direction	at which a
	species' range moves through time).
