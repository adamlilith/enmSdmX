Description: Tools for implementing species distribution models and ecological
	niche models, including: bias correction, spatial cross-validation, model
	evaluation, raster interpolation, biotic "velocity" (speed and
	direction of movement of a "mass" represented by a raster), and functions
	for using spatially imprecise records. The heart of the package is a set
	of "training" functions which automatically tune and parameterize models
	based on several popular algorithms (e.g., MaxEnt, MaxNet, boosted
	regression trees, generalized additive models, etc.). To enhance
	transportability to and from other packages, the package uses base-R
	classes as much as possible.
