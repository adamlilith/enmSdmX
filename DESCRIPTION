Description: Tools for implementing species distribution models and ecological
	niche models, including: bias correction, spatial cross-validation, model
	evaluation, raster interpolation, biotic "velocity" (speed and
	direction of movement of a "mass" represented by a raster), interpolating
	across a time series of rasters, and tools for using spatially imprecise
	records. The heart of the package is a set of "training" functions which
	automatically optimize model complexity	based number of available
	occurrences. These algorithms include MaxEnt, MaxNet, boosted regression
	trees/gradient boosting machines, generalized additive models,
	generalized linear models, natural splines, and random forests. To enhance
	interoperability to and from other packages, the package does not create
	any new classes. The package works with PROJ6 geodetic objects and
	coordinate reference systems.
