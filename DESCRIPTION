Description: Tools for implementing species distribution models (SDMs) and
	ecological niche models (ENMs), including: bias correction, spatial
	cross-validation, model evaluation, raster interpolation, and biotic
	"velocity" (speed and direction of movement of a "mass" represented by
	a raster). The heart of the package is a set of "training" functions
	which automatically tune and parameterize models based on several popular
	algorithms (e.g., MaxEnt, MaxNet, GLMs, GAMs, BRTs, etc.).
